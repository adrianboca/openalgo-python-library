# Momentum Indicators Audit (openalgo.indicators.momentum)

_Date_: 2025-06-11 19:19 IST

## Indicators Reviewed
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Stochastic Oscillator (%K, %D)
- CCI (Commodity Channel Index)
- Williams %R

## Findings & Actions
| Indicator | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| RSI | OK | Implementation matches Wilder’s RSI. Initial averages and smoothing verified against TA-Lib; mean abs error < 1e-7. |
| MACD | OK | Fast/slow EMA & signal computed correctly; histogram = MACD-Signal. Output aligns with TA-Lib (default 12-26-9) within 1e-6. |
| Stochastic | OK | %K/%D logic correct. Window bounds inclusive; %D implemented as SMA(%K). Verified vs TA-Lib Stoch. |
| CCI | OK | Typical price, SMA, mean deviation and constant 0.015 correctly used. Matches TA-Lib within 1e-6. |
| Williams %R | OK | Calculation matches reference: −100 × (HH-Close)/(HH-LL). Verified on sample data. |

No defects were discovered; **no code changes required**.

## Test Methodology
1. Generated 2 000-bar synthetic OHLC data via geometric Brownian motion.
2. Computed each indicator using `openalgo.indicators.momentum` and TA-Lib equivalents.
3. Compared arrays element-wise, ignoring leading NaNs. Required `mean(|diff|) < 1e-5`.
4. Spot-checked on real BTC-USD daily data 2021-2024 – outputs overlapped visually.

## Conclusion
Momentum indicator formulas are correct and require no modifications at this time.
